SO SHE WENT INTO THE GARDEN TO CUT A CABBAGE-LEAF, TO
MAKE AN APPLE-PIE; AND AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT
SHE-BEAR, COMING UP THE STREET, POPS ITS HEAD INTO THE
SHOP. 'WHAT! NO SOAP?' SO HE DIED, AND SHE VERY
IMPRUDENTLY MARRIED THE BARBER; AND THERE WERE
PRESENT THE PICNINNIES, AND THE JOBLILLIES, AND THE
GARYALIES, AND THE GRAND PANJANDRUM HIMSELF, WITH THE
LITTLE ROUND BUTTON AT TOP, AND THEY ALL FELL TO PLAYING
THE GAME OF CATCH AS CATCH CAN, TILL THE GUN POWDER RAN
OUT AT THE HEELS OF THEIR BOOTS.
